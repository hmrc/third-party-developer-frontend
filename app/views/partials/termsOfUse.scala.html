<p>These terms of use explain what you can expect from us and what we expect from you when creating and operating software services that consume HMRC Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) hosted on the HMRC Developer Hub.
    They do not create a legal relationship between HMRC and any software developer.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove your access to the Developer Hub and its APIs temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>These terms may change from time to time and we will let you know when this happens. For major changes you may need to re-accept these terms of use, but for minor changes we will assume you agree to the changes unless we hear from you.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">Accessing data</h3>
        <p>You must give your users access to their data. We may also ask to access their data if we open an investigation.</p>
        <p>If you withdraw a piece of software or a user stops using it, you must let them retrieve and export all their data so they can meet their obligations to us.</p>
        <p>We recommend using multi-factor authentication to protect personal data.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 class="heading-medium">Processing data</h3>
        <p>You may need to pay a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/guide-to-the-data-protection-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data protection fee (opens in a new tab)</a> if your software processes personal data.</p>
        <p>You must help us protect our users’ confidential data by sending us particular types of user audit data which we will record. Our APIs provide HTTP headers that you can use to pass this audit data to us. See how to do this under <a href="@{applicationConfig.thirdPartyDeveloperFrontendUrl}/api-documentation/docs/fraud-prevention">fraud prevention</a>.</p>
        <p>Supplying header information for all our APIs will become mandatory - so we recommend designing it into your applications now.</p>
        <p>To find out if header information is mandatory for an API that you use, read its <a href="@{applicationConfig.thirdPartyDeveloperFrontendUrl}/api-documentation/docs/api">API documentation</a>.</p>

            <li>If we remove your access, we’ll tell your users and give them time to find other ways to submit information - during this period we won’t give them penalties or charge interest for late submissions.</li>
            <li>We can remove your access to the API Platform for a number of reasons, including:

                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                    <li>it’s supported by a final UK court decision (or the equivalent in the country you’re based)</li>
                    <li>or we can show you’ve broken those rules in another way</li>
                </ul>
                However, we won’t remove your access in this case if you’ve repaid everything you owe (plus interest and fines), or you’ve made arrangements with us to pay the amount.</li>
            <li>If you’re listed on GOV.UK, we may remove you.</li>
